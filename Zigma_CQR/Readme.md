By integrating Zigzag Mamba (ZigMa) and Conditional Quantile Regression (CQR) into an object tracking and classification project, we can leverage the strengths of both models. 
ZigMa can be used for efficient visual data processing.
CQR can handle uncertainties in object tracking and classification.
